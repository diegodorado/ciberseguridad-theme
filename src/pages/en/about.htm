<h3>Observatory Report 2015</h3>
<h4>Cybersecurity in Latin America and the Caribbean</h4>
<h5>Executive Summary </h5>
<p>   </p>
  <p>
  The Observatory Report 2015: Cybersecurity in Latin America and the Caribbean is the result of a collaborative effort between the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Organization of American States (OAS) to present a comprehensive and up-to-date picture of the state of cybersecurity of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Using an online tool designed in partnership with the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre (GCSCC) of the University of Oxford, the OAS-IDB gathered data from cybersecurity stakeholders representing different sectors. These stakeholders include: government agencies, critical infrastructure operators, the military, law enforcement, the private sector and academia. Additional information was acquired through various secondary sources, which has been cited throughout the report.  </p>
<p>This report comprises two main sections. The first section consists of perspectives on cybersecurity trends in the region contributed by international cybersecurity experts. In “Cyber Confidence Building and Diplomacy in Latin America and the Caribbean”, James A. Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) explores the role of international cooperation in norm creation and regulation for cybersecurity and cybercrime. Lewis highlights the work of regional and international mechanisms to promote international cooperation in protecting cyberspace. In “Cybersecurity, privacy and trust: Trends in Latin America and the Caribbean region and the way forward”, Marilia Maciel, Nathalia Foditsch, Luca Belli and Nicolas Castellon of the Center of Technology and Society (CTS) of the Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) discuss the challenge of balancing information exchange with privacy and freedom of expression, noting the importance of measures such as privacy and data protection regulatory frameworks and multistakeholder platforms, among others. In the following segment, Maarten Van Horenbeeck, Cristine Hoepers and Pete Allor of the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) write on the need for training and educational opportunities for Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) as well as a “strong, inclusive community of CSIRTs”. Next, Alexander Seger of the Council of Europe (CoE) examines how countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have designed and updated their legislative frameworks for dealing with cybercrime, with special emphasis on the Budapest Convention, and presents a number of case studies. In “Digital Economy and Cybersecurity in Latin America and the Caribbean”, the World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Agenda Council on Cybersecurity discusses the connections between ICT Development, cybersecurity and the national economies of Latin America and the Caribbean. Finally, Melissa Hathaway and Francesca Spidalieri of the Potomac Institute offer their thoughts on how sustainability and security are essential to ensure long-term economic viability of ICT innovation and growth. </p>
<p>The second section provides an overview of the current state of cyber security in the countries in the Latin America and the Caribbean region based on information gathered through the online tool designed in partnership with GCSCC, interviews with States officials and desk research.  The data collected was analyzed using the 49 indicators of the Cyber Security Capability Maturity Model developed by the GCSCC, which are divided into five dimensions: 1) National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy; 2) Cyber Culture and Society; 3) Cybersecurity Education, Training and Skills; 4) Legal and Regulatory Frameworks; and 5) Standards, Organizations and Technologies. There are five levels of maturity for each indicator: 1) Start-up; 2) Formative; 3) Established; 4) Strategic; and 5) Dynamic. Professor Sadie Creese, of the GCSCC at the University of Oxford, gives her perspectives on the findings and introduces the country profiles including highlights of regional trends. Each country profile provides a short overview of recent cybersecurity developments in the country, statistics on the country’s population, number of people with Internet access, mobile phone subscriptions, and percentage of Internet penetration. In addition, each profile shows the country’s maturity levels for each indicator. </p>
<p>There is no single way to read this report. The Report is intended to present a comprehensive depiction of cybersecurity in the region. National stakeholders from diverse sectors can utilize this information to gain a better understanding of their country’s cybersecurity situation within a regional context. This Report can also help governments and cybersecurity experts explore new ideas for strengthening cybersecurity in their respective countries and across the hemisphere.
