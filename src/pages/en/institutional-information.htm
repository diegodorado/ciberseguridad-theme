    <h4>About the Organization of American States (OAS)</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The Organization of American States is the world’s oldest regional organization, dating back to the First International Conference of American States, held in Washington, D.C., from October 1889 to April 1890. That meeting approved the establishment of the International Union of American Republics, and the stage was set for the weaving of a web of provisions and institutions that came to be known as the inter-American system, the oldest international institutional system.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The Organization was established in order to achieve among its member states "an order of peace and justice, to promote their solidarity, to strengthen their collaboration, and to defend their sovereignty, their territorial integrity, and their independence."
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Today, the OAS brings together all 35 independent states of the Americas and constitutes the main political, juridical, and social governmental forum in the Hemisphere. The Organization uses a four-pronged approach to effectively implement its essential purposes, based on its main pillars: democracy, human rights, security, and development.

    <h4>IDB’s Support to the Cyber Security Agenda</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The report “Latin American and Caribbean Cyber Security Trends” (LAC), published in June 2014, indicates that, despite the progress made in the fight against cybercrime, an analysis of the situation in the region in 2013 leaves a clear message about the need for all involved to increase their efforts regarding legislation and policies reform, developing technical skills, increasing awareness, sharing information and cooperating with other stakeholders. The reality is that according to the “Internet Security Threat Report 2014”, many of these messages apply to most of the nations around the world.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      In light of this global movement to raise awareness about the importance of proactive cyber defense and according to its commitment to safeguard the interests of the LAC region and support governments to better serve their citizens, the Department of Institutions for Development (IFD) through the Division of Institutional Capacity of State (ICS) has launched a Regional Technical Cooperation with the ultimate aim to assist beneficiary countries in designing national cybersecurity strategies in accordance with the most recognized international standards thereby strengthening public safety.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      To achieve this goal, the Bank is undertaking various activities including: knowledge generation, technical assistance, training and the exchange of experiences. This will allow its member countries to better understand the challenges and threats emanating from the use of new technologies and leverage the other countries’ knowledge to successfully confront those threats. In the knowledge-based society, socio-economic progress of the region and safety of its citizens are built on a secure cyber environment.
    </p>

    <h4>OAS Support to the Cyber Security Agenda</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The Cyber Security Program of the Organization of American States (OAS) has been working to strengthen cyber security capacities in OAS Member States since the early 2000s. Over the years, it has become a regional leader in assisting Member States to build technical and policy-level cyber security capacity to ensure a secure and resilient cyberspace. The Cyber Security Program’s support initiatives based on an in-depth analysis and understanding of the extent of cyber threats in a given country, and of existing national capabilities to deal with such threats. In addition, the Program promotes the engagement of partners and stakeholders from different sectors, ensuring that government, private sector and civil society directly participate in the formulation of cyber security policies.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      In 2004, the OAS became the first regional body to adopt a cyber security strategy through the unanimous approval of “The Comprehensive Inter-American Cyber Security Strategy,” which provides a mandate to the OAS General Secretariat to assist Member States in the creation and strengthening of their cyber security capabilities. Recognizing the evolving nature of cyber security threats, OAS Member States renewed their commitment to cyber security by adopting, in 2012, the declaration on “Strengthening Cyber Security in the Americas” and, more recently, the “Declaration on the Protection of Critical Infrastructure from Emerging Threats” (2015). These instruments are critical for the promotion of politically cohesive cyber security policies in the Americas.
