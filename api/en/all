With this larger digital community, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda has begun to prioritize cyber security as a national concern.  Consultations among stakeholders are taking place to develop a national cyber security strategy and a national CSIRT. Informal cyber security responsibilities fall under the Ministry of Information, Broadcasting, Telecommunications, Science and Technology, while the Organization of National Drug and Money Laundering Control Policy (ONDCP) serves as the National Point of Contact for international organizations, including the OAS. Antigua and Barbuda is also a member of ITU-IMPACT. \r\n\r\nCritical national infrastructure (CNI) operators generally understand risks to cyber security and implement certain security standards and technologies to improve resilience, although there is no entity designated to implement standards uniformly. Further, without a designated emergency-response mechanism, the country is unable to maintain accurate information on cyber security threats and respond to events.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, the Government passed three laws to accompany the existing Electronic Transfer of Funds Crimes Act (2006) and strengthen the country\u2019s legal framework for information and communications technology (ICT): the Electronics Crimes Act, the Electronic Evidence Act and the Data Protection Act. The Regional Cyber Investigation Laboratory (RCIL) of the Royal Police Force of Antigua and Barbuda investigates cybercrime both nationally and in the Caribbean Region. It also processes digital evidence to be presented in cybercrime cases. Antigua and Barbuda does not have a formal disclosure mechanism for the private sector, however, and few cyberattacks are reported to the authorities. In that regard, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda has also acceded to articles 16, 17(e) and 34(c) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which recognizes the rights of children to be protected from malicious actions, including cybercrime and child pornography. \r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Information has developed plans for a cyber security awareness-raising campaign in partnership with the Connect Antigua and Barbuda Initiative, no campaign is currently underway. Cyber security education opportunities in the country are limited, but the Antigua and Barbuda International Institute of Technology offers coursework on the topic. Private sector firms are becoming increasingly aware about cyber security risks and have begun to take up initiatives to train employees.","population":"92436","people_with_computer":"89","people_with_internet":"81545","mobile_phone_subscriptions":"110923","maturity_levels":{"1":"1","2":"1","3":"1","4":"1","5":"1","6":"1","7":"1","8":"2","9":"1","10":"1","11":"1","12":"1","13":"2","14":"2","15":"1","16":"1","17":"2","18":"1","19":"2","20":"2","21":"2","22":"2","23":"3","24":"1","25":"2","26":"2","27":"2","28":"1","29":"1","30":"1","31":"1","32":"1","33":"1","34":"1","35":"1","36":"1","37":"2","38":"1","39":"2","40":"1","41":"1","42":"1","43":"1","44":"1","45":"1","46":"1","47":"1","48":"1","49":"1"}},{"id":"2","code":"ar","name":"Argentina","excerpt":"","description":"Led by the National Program for Critical Information Infrastructure and Cyber Security (ICIC) in coordination with various agencies, academic institutions and the private sector, the Government of Argentina has developed a draft National Cyber Security Strategy that is currently awaiting adoption. Argentina is notable for forming the first national CSIRT in 1994; since 2011, it has functioned under the ICIC. ICIC-CERT maintains a central registry of cyber security events and threats. The Armed Forces run annual Cyber Incident Response Exercises (ENRIC) to share best practices and review Command and Control functions; however, they currently have limited capacity for cyber resilience. \r\n\r\nPreviously, critical national infrastructure (CNI) was managed more-or-less informally; however, in June of 2015, the Presidency of the Republic of Argentina issued Decree No. 1067\/2015, which restructured government control of CNI, establishing a National Office within the Under-secretariat for the Protection of Critical Information and Cybersecurity Infrastructure, under the Head Office of the Cabinet of Ministers \u2013 Cabinet Secretariat. This new program will work to develop cybersecurity norms and standards as well as collaborate with the private sector to improve CNI resilience. \r\n\r\nAmidst increases in cybercrime, the Government of Argentina has constructed a comprehensive legal framework for ICT, including Law 26.388, Penal Code and Law 25.326 on data protection. It is also developing procedural law for handing digital evidence. While mechanisms are in place for disclosure, the private sector is not legally required to report breaches to cyber security. Nevertheless, awareness of cybersecurity risks among businesses has grown significantly. The Technology Crimes Division of the Argentina Federal Police Force (PFA) is responsible for investigating cases of cybercrime, and takes on a number of capacities, including providing information on how to detect and report cyberattacks. \r\n\r\nAs Argentina\u2019s e-government and e-commerce services continue to expand, government agencies have led awareness-raising campaigns to educate the public about cyber security. Two notable examples are Internet Sano (\u201cHealthy\u201d or \u201cSound\u201d Internet) led by the ICIC, which focuses on best practices for safe internet use, and \u201cWith You on the Web\u201d under the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, which teaches children, parents and teachers about the threat of online grooming (the predatory befriending of children on the web to lure them into sexual abuse or trafficking).

Implementation of these measures, however, has been slow, and authorities have cited a lack of funding for cyber security and limited interagency cooperation as hurdles to progress. \r\n\r\nIn June of 2015, the Barbados Government Information Service\u2019s website was targeted by hackers. Fortunately, within hours authorities were able to restore the website and mitigate the attack.  While the banking sector and some major businesses have adopted stronger cyber security measures, authorities believe that many private-sector companies and some government agencies lack adequate structures to defend themselves from cyber threats. \r\n\r\nThe Cybercrime Unit of the Royal Barbados Police Force (RBPF) is the primary agency responsible for investigating cases of cybercrime. The unit receives technical training from regional and international experts in cyber security, and is working to create its own digital forensics lab. In Regards to cybercrime, the RBPF enforces the Computer Misuse Act, 2005-4, which includes both substantive and procedural law for cybercrime investigation. Barbados has also signed into law the Mutual assistance in Criminal Matters Act, Chapter 140a Section 6, which allows the Government of Barbados to request assistance from Commonwealth Countries in obtaining electronic evidence.   \r\n\r\nThree-quarters of Barbados\u2019s population is connected to the internet, and cyber security stakeholders are concerned that much of society is unaware of risks and vulnerabilities associated with using information technology.  To raise awareness, Barbados is part of the ITU\u2019s THINKCLICKSURF campaign. As part of the campaign, the RBPF is touring primary and secondary schools across the country to educate students on safe internet practices, privacy and online bullying.

The committee has received assistance from the OAS Cyber Security Program. In addition, Belize is planning a National ICT Innovation Policy, which seeks to expand e-government services as well as implement related cyber security measures. Additionally, the Central Information Technology Organization (CITO) is also finalizing its E-Government Policy, Strategy & Action Plan. The country also participates in the Caribbean Telecommunication Union (CTU)-CARICOM HIPCAR Project, an effort to unify ICT innovation efforts across the region.\r\n\r\nBelize has neither a cyber-defense policy nor a national CSIRT; consequently, cyberattacks are mainly handled by the IT Unit of the Belize Police Department (PITU). PITU notably provided cyber security assistance in coordination with CARICOM for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, and it regularly communicates with regional CIRTs. Belize has enacted four laws related to cybercrime, namely: The Telecommunication Act, Electronic Evidence Act, Intellectual Property Act and Interception of Communication Act. Without comprehensive criminal law, however, law enforcement and the judiciary face difficulty effectively prosecuting cybercrime.  Accordingly, although there is no binding agreement for the disclosure of breaches in cyber security, government and the private sector cooperate to report and address cyberattacks, and while statistics are limited, the Government of Belize has noted an increase in incidents in recent years.\r\n\r\nIn response to growing threats to cyber security in the region, government has begun to promote strengthened security standards and technology among agencies and CNI operators; however, stakeholders have not formulated response plans or other crisis-management policies in relation to CNI protection. \r\n\r\nWith 31.7% internet penetration, much of Belizean society has not developed a cyber security mind-set.  In order to raise awareness of cyber security issues, the Belize Police Department participates in the an annual \u201cICT Road Show\u201d, which is hosted by the Ministry of Energy, Science & Technology, Public Utilities (MESTPU). The BPD uses this platform to educate communities on both the opportunities and risks of cyber space. This year, with the support of the private sector, academia and other stakeholders, the Government of Belize plans to hold its First Annual Cyber Security Week.

The ADSIB\u2019s objectives include coordinating efforts to expand Information and Communications Technology (ICT), raising societal awareness of cyber security and partnering with the private sector and civil society on projects.  The Government of Bolivia has not developed an official cyber security strategy or policy.  Furthermore, it previously had to coordinate incident response through other countries\u2019 CIRTs, for example addressing a threat to CNI through ArCERT of Argentina; however, in 2015, Bolivia\u2019s official Computer Incident Response Team, CSIRT-BO, went operational. \r\n\r\nBolivia strengthened its national IT infrastructure in 2013 with the development of a national Internet Exchange Point (IXP), called PIT-BOLIVIA.

The Plurinational Legislative Assembly has also passed Article 281o of Law No 3325 (2006) against human trafficking, child pornography and other nefarious acts that often involve the internet. No specific legislation concerning cybercrime exists. Nonetheless, the country has developed a Draft law on E-Documents, E-Signatures and E-Commerce intended to improve resiliency of IT infrastructure and strengthen national cyber security. The IITCUP cites the lack of a formal channel for obtaining timely disclosure of cyberattacks as a major concern for law enforcement going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the ADSIB provides a variety of literature detailing safe internet use on its website as well as training seminars, to date the Government of Bolivia has not led any national awareness-raising campaign on the matter.

In light of its increased adoption of ICTs, Brazil has become a prime target of cyberattacks and cybercrime, including waves of spear-phishing, malware, and DDoS attacks leading up to  the 2014 World Cup. As it prepares for the 2016 Olympic Games, the Rio de Janeiro Administration has built an integrated urban command center.  \r\n\r\n In 2010, the Department of Information Security and Communications (DSIC) published the Reference Guide for the Security of Critical Information Infrastructures and the Green Paper on Cyber Security in Brazil. These documents served as foundations for the newly released national Information Communications Security and Cyber Security Strategy of the Federal Public Administration.  The Brazilian Armed Forces also discusses cyber-defense concerns in its 2012 White Book of National Defense. It recently set up a formal Cyber Defense Command and a National Cyber Defense School, in addition to the Army\u2019s Center for Cyber Defense (CDCiber). \r\n\r\nBrazil has many Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), which range from government-managed entities to private-sector or academic teams. The Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (CGI.br) is in charge of coordinating all Internet service initiatives in the country, and the Brazilian Network Information Center (NIC.br) works to implement such initiatives.  The Brazilian National Computer Incident Response team (CERT.BR), which operates under CGI.br and NIC.br, is responsible for incident response and coordination, training and awareness-raising campaigns. Brazil\u2019s Department of Information and Communications Security (DSIC) also maintains a CSIRT, CTIR.gov, which provides incident-response and data-collection services for the Federal Public Administration. \r\n\r\nBrazil\u2019s framework for addressing illicit cyber activities is anchored upon Law No 12.965\/2014, the \u201cCivil Rights Framework for the Internet\u201d and Law No 12.737\/2012, which formally criminalizes cybercrime. A proposed law on Internet privacy and data retention by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is now open for public comment. The Office for the Repression of Cybercrime (SRCC) of the Federal Police (DPF) is the primary entity for investigating cybercrime and has a digital forensics lab.  Some states in Brazil also have specialized prosecution teams. Although the private sector is not required to disclose cyber incidents, the SRCC has a working relationship with companies. \r\n\r\nPublic understanding of cyber security issues in Brazil is generally low, and organizations such as CGI.br and NIC.br have sought to address this by issuing numerous bulletins and awareness-raising campaigns. The private sector is becoming more informed about the need for better protection from cyber threats. Companies and critical infrastructure operators have implemented privacy requirements for employees and are developing procurement and technology standards. A strong domestic market for cyber security technologies also exists.

The state also coordinates crisis-management planning and has put redundancy measures in place. \r\n\r\nBranches of the Armed Forces of Chile share information and cyber-defense responsibilities, but do not have a central Command and Control structure. One of Chile\u2019s major challenges going forward is strengthening its incident-response capabilities: CSIRT-CL, in operation since 2004, provides incident response for government websites, but is not formally institutionalized at the national level to address all types of breaches. \r\n\r\nChile has established a comprehensive legal framework for dealing with cybercrime. Supreme Decree No. 1299 describes norms and delineates roles for handling cybercrime, Law No 19.223 introduces cybercrimes to the penal code, and Law No 19.628 covers data protection and privacy. Although the private sector is not required by law to disclose breaches, government works closely with companies to report and respond to cyber incidents. According to Chilean authorities, phishing, malware and hacking are the most frequent types of cyberattacks in the country. The Criminal Organizations Investigations Department (OS-9) and the Department of Criminology (LABOCAR) of the Caribineros, Chile\u2019s national police force, carry out investigations and analyze digital forensics, respectively.

Nevertheless, judicial authorities struggle to effectively prosecute cybercrime cases as a limited number of prosecutors and judges have the capacity to build and handle cases involving electronic evidence, although the Public Force does manage a digital forensics laboratory. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, in 2012 the Government of Costa Rica established CSIRT-CR (housed under the MICITT).  CSIRT-CR is the national agency entrusted with the task of not only responding to disruptions to cyber security but also coordinating national Command and Control functions. The agency has received technical assistance from OAS and other regional and international experts, and has successfully detected and mitigated major cyber-security threats, most notably a 2013 DoS attack to the Costa Rican Electrical Institute (ICE) that originated in Russia. There is currently no public registry of incidents, although the government is in the process of developing one. Costa Rica has no permanent military, and the Public Force (Fuerza P\u00fablica) has limited structures and capacity for building cyber resilience. \r\n\r\nThe public sector and CNI organizations have taken up and promoted international security standards, such as ISO\/IEC 27001, but the private sector has not yet followed, and the lack of clear norms for ISP registry continues to slow cyber-security progress.  Nevertheless, groups such as ICE have pushed for software development standards, and the private sector participates in the cyber security marketplace, investing in information technology control systems and discussing the need for cybercrime insurance. Finally, the importance of employee privacy is recognized in the private sector and privacy policies are beginning to be institutionalized.\r\n\r\nPublic awareness of cyber security is generally low, and society takes few steps to protect itself from cyber threats. In response, ICE and other foundations have led awareness-raising campaigns, however with limited diffusion and few measurement mechanisms. Opportunities for cyber-security education and training, however, are becoming available in Costa Rica, through bachelors, masters and certification programs at Cenfotec University.","population":"4755234","people_with_computer":"0","people_with_internet":"2511139","mobile_phone_subscriptions":"8847536","maturity_levels":{"1":"2","2":"1","3":"1","4":"1","5":"1","6":"1","7":"2","8":"3","9":"1","10":"1","11":"2","12":"2","13":"2","14":"3","15":"2","16":"2","17":"2","18":"1","19":"2","20":"2","21":"3","22":"3","23":"3","24":"3","25":"3","26":"2","27":"2","28":"1","29":"2","30":"2","31":"2","32":"2","33":"2","34":"2","35":"2","36":"2","37":"2","38":"1","39":"1","40":"1","41":"1","42":"1","43":"1","44":"1","45":"1","46":"2","47":"2","48":"2","49":"2"}},{"id":"11","code":"dm","name":"Dominica","excerpt":"","description":"Starting with very little existing infrastructure, the Government of Dominica has taken great strides in recent years to develop a national cybersecurity policy and strategy.

In addition to describing national risks and development goals, the draft strategy defines mandates for the creation of a national CSIRT. \r\n\r\nDominica\u2019s paramount counter-cybercrime authority, the Criminal Investigations Department of the Commonwealth of Dominica Police Force, is the sole entity in charge of handling and investigating cases of cybercrime in the country.

The country\u2019s government is currently drafting comprehensive cybercrime law to be adopted in parliament, and is pursuing accession to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (commonly known as the \u2018Budapest Convention\u2019), a binding international treaty. Privacy and data protection legislation, however, is largely nonexistent. \r\n\r\nAlthough its draft strategy describes important national risks, Dominica does not have a coordinated cyber defense policy. Command and Control functions are handled ad hoc government departments in cases of cyber events. While owners of critical infrastructure understand cyber-security risks and CNI technology generally complies with international ITO standards, national resilience and response efforts are conducted informally, without any overarching structure.\r\n\r\nLeading firms, such as financial institutions, and some e-commerce services have taken proactive steps to raise private-sector awareness of phishing and other cyberattacks, and are beginning to institutionalize employee privacy standards. Civil society, however, is generally unaware of cyber threats. As part of its draft strategy, the Government of Dominica is developing awareness-raising campaigns to address this issue. \r\n\r\nThe Dominican State College Business Training Center and a handful of online and private academic institutions offer cybersecurity-related education and training, but without coordination or input from the Ministry of Education or the establishment of public-private partnerships. Nonetheless, the Dominican Government has hosted a number of regional and international conferences to share best practices on cyber security.","population":"73449","people_with_computer":"0","people_with_internet":"43335","mobile_phone_subscriptions":"93280","maturity_levels":{"1":"2","2":"1","3":"1","4":"1","5":"1","6":"1","7":"2","8":"2","9":"1","10":"1","11":"2","12":"2","13":"2","14":"2","15":"2","16":"1","17":"1","18":"1","19":"2","20":"2","21":"2","22":"1","23":"2","24":"1","25":"2","26":"2","27":"2","28":"1","29":"2","30":"1","31":"1","32":"1","33":"1","34":"1","35":"1","36":"1","37":"2","38":"1","39":"1","40":"1","41":"1","42":"1","43":"1","44":"2","45":"1","46":"1","47":"1","48":"1","49":"1"}},{"id":"12","code":"ec","name":"Ecuador","excerpt":"","description":"Although it has not developed a national cyber security strategy, Ecuador has taken strides in recent years to strengthen its capacity for addressing cyber threats.

The country maintains a national CSIRT, SalCERT, which responds to cyberattacks and coordinates with other regional response teams. SalCERT has had some success monitoring and addressing threats, but its capacity is limited due to budget constraints. \r\n\r\nAlthough the Armed Forces of El Salvador have identified risks and important areas of infrastructure for protection, it does not have an official cyber-defense policy. Nevertheless, government formally manages security for CNI, and is planning risk-management exercises to establish roles and responsibilities and identify gaps in cyber security. \r\n\r\nThe Legislative Assembly of El Salvador has enacted laws on data protection and access to public information, which both establishes norms for transparency and freedom of information, but also protects citizens\u2019 personal information. It has also drafted cybercrime legislation that is awaiting adoption. There is a formal mechanism for requesting disclosure from the private sector in cases of cybercrime; however, requests must be issued directly from the Attorney General\u2019s Office, which can delay investigation efforts.

Since 2012 Grenada has articulated the need for a national CIRT. The National Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (NTRC) is tasked with implementing cyber security strategy and policy; however, as of 2015 neither a national strategy nor a CSIRT have been formed. The NTRC also helps coordinate security for CNI operators, but authorities have informed that it currently plays a limited role. While government at-large is generally not trained in cyber security, the country\u2019s primary entity for cyber-defense and cybercrime investigation, the Royal Grenada Police Force (RGPF), has received cyber-security training from the US Government\u2019s Antiterrorism Assistance Program. \r\n\r\nThe ICT division of the RGPF investigates breaches in cyber security and cybercrime. A member of the force reported that from 2012-2015, it investigated 21 cases; of those that made it to court, one was successfully prosecuted and one was in progress. The absence of a formal disclosure mechanism for the private sector, however, may impede efforts to uncover cybercrime. While the RGPF maintains some equipment for digital forensic analysis, it is in need of updated software and other tools. Furthermore, the judiciary typically lacks the digital court capacity necessary to handle electronic evidence. \r\n\r\nIn 2013, Grenada Parliament passed the Electronic Crimes Act, which formally added cybercrime to the penal code and established procedures for its prosecution. While some provisions of the law caused scrutiny over their potential for limiting civil liberties, parliament has since amended such sections in order to protect freedom of expression. Grenada has also drafted legislation for data protection and freedom of information, although it has not yet been adopted. \r\n\r\nAs internet connectivity expands in Grenada, many new e-commerce services have become available. Boards of managers at private firms have some understanding of cyber security, and are considering implementing greater security standards for technology and privacy standards for employees. While critical national infrastructure (CNI) technology may follow the standards applied by initial developers, its operation is often conducted with limited governmental control. There are currently no cyber security degree programs or other related educational opportunities within the country for Grenadian citizens.","population":"110152","people_with_computer":"0","people_with_internet":"47903","mobile_phone_subscriptions":"139893","maturity_levels":{"1":"1","2":"1","3":"1","4":"1","5":"1","6":"1","7":"1","8":"1","9":"1","10":"1","11":"1","12":"1","13":"1","14":"2","15":"1","16":"1","17":"1","18":"1","19":"2","20":"2","21":"2","22":"2","23":"2","24":"2","25":"2","26":"1","27":"2","28":"1","29":"1","30":"1","31":"1","32":"1","33":"1","34":"1","35":"1","36":"1","37":"2","38":"1","39":"1","40":"1","41":"1","42":"1","43":"1","44":"1","45":"1","46":"1","47":"1","48":"1","49":"1"}},{"id":"15","code":"gt","name":"Guatemala","excerpt":"","description":"Although leading government agencies have begun to place priority on cyber security issues and assess national risks, Guatemala has no express national cyber security strategy.

CSIRT-gt has received training from the OAS and other international institutions. Recently, the Ministry of Interior (Gobernacion) has also shown interest in moving the cyber security agenda forward in Guatemala. \r\n\r\nWith assistance provided by CSIRT-gt, law enforcement maintains some capacity to investigate cyberattacks and cybercrime, but authorities argue that until comprehensive cybercrime legislation is passed the judicial system will have difficulty effectively prosecuting cases. Furthermore, there is no policy for disclosure in place, and, apart from certain financial institutions, the private sector rarely reports cyber-events to the government. Nevertheless, the private sector does have its own incident-response entity, CERT Cyberseg. \r\n\r\nIn the wake of a spike in cyberattacks against government infrastructure over the last several years, Guatemalan agencies have begun to take steps to secure their national assets, albeit with little formal communication.

It also regularly coordinates with the OAS and other national CSIRTs to build technical capacity and share best practices and information, and is beginning to establish lines of communication with the private sector. CIRT-GY\u2019s scope is limited, however, by the absence of a national cyber security strategy or cyber defense policy and a lack of awareness of cyber-security issues in government. Furthermore, owners of Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) do not always adhere to security standards or report incidents, and the state has not formally assessed its CNI assets and vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\nWhen cybercrime occurs, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Guyana Police Force is responsible for investigating the case.

Recently, a working group was established within CONATEL with the mandate to develop a strategic plan and a roadmap for cybersecurity and counter-cybercrime. \r\n\r\nWhile awareness of cyber security is growing in government, preparedness varies by agency.

Legislative efforts have stalled, however, as disagreements over elections led to the dissolution of most of Haiti\u2019s Parliament as of January of 2015.  Until this political crisis is resolved, it will be very difficult for the country to adopt a comprehensive legal framework for cybercrime.

Two years later, it has designed a comprehensive national strategy, released on January 28th, 2015, and is creating a national CIRT. At the helm of these developments is the National Cyber Security Task Force (NCSTF), which was established under the Ministry of Science, Technology, Energy and Mining (MSTEM). The OAS Cyber Security program and other international organizations have assisted Jamaica in developing its CSIRT. Notably, following a spate of cyberattacks against government websites in late 2014, the OAS sent a team of experts to Kingston to provide incident-management support.  Cyber defense authorities have received post-incident training, but unlike civilian government do not have a unified policy. The next major cyber-security challenges for the Government of Jamaica will be ensuring widespread adherence to standards and coordinating Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) security, as operators have some capacity to protect their critical infrastructures from threats, but security is not formally managed by government. \r\n\r\nIn March of 2010, Jamaica passed the Cybercrimes Act. Corresponding to changes in technology and threats, in 2013 Parliament organized a committee to report on the law\u2019s status and make revisions as needed. The Communication Forensic and Cybercrime Unit (CFCU) of the Jamaican Constabulary Force (JCF) is a fully-operational law enforcement agency designated for cybercrime investigation. The CFCU has its own digital forensics lab. One challenge law enforcement faces is the underreporting of incidents by affected parties; MSTEM has therefore been pushing for the legislature to bring a disclosure policy into effect.

This document, together with a position paper on \u201cResilience of Critical Infrastructure, Protection of Minors on the Internet and Cyber Security\u201d, establishes goals and delineates roles and responsibilities. Since then, government agencies have begun the initial stages of developing internal cyber-security plans. The publications also seek to address a lack of awareness among stakeholders about CNI protection, which authorities have indicated as a major concern. While some security standards are in place, there is currently limited coordination among operators for CNI protection.

In the case of a cyberattack or related event, CSIRT PANAMA is the agency in charge of responding to and mitigating the incident. \r\n\r\nWith amendments to the country\u2019s penal code and laws concerning the obtaining of evidence, Panama has updated national legislation to more effectively combat cybercrime. Data-protection laws have also been in place since 2009. In 2014, Panama underwent official accession to the Budapest Convention, the first international treaty addressing cybercrime. \r\n\r\nPanama handles cases of cybercrime on two fronts: through the Investigative Unit for Computer Crimes, under the Directorate of Judicial Investigation, and through the Special Prosecutor for Crimes against Intellectual Property and Information Security. Authorities have indicated sharp increases in cyberattacks in recent years, with 262 cases in 2013.

Fortunately, Peru\u2019s computer incident response team PeCERT successfully responded to these attacks. In addition to incident response, PeCERT also discusses cyber security issues with the police, military and the private sector and is updating and expanding its capacities. With technical assistance from the OAS, the Government of Peru is developing a National Cyber Security Strategy, for which the National Office of Electronic and IT Governance (ONGEI) has assumed responsibility.

In the field of cyber defense, the Ministry of Defense\u2019s National Defense Policy includes measures related to ICT security. \r\n\r\nWhile Suriname has general laws concerning the privacy of individuals, it does not have a legal framework for dealing with cybercrime. The Office of the Attorney General is primarily responsible for handling national cybercrime cases. While criminal justice authorities have some capacity, the lack of digital forensic services or responsible reporting mechanisms entails a great challenge to the effective prosecution of cybercrime. \r\n\r\nPrivate-Sector and Critical-National-Infrastructure (CNI) stakeholders are becoming more concerned with their level of cyber security. Government maintains a general list of CNI assets and vulnerabilities, and private firms, especially in the banking and telecommunications sectors, are discussing privacy-protection measures and investing in training employees in cyber security. Similarly, these industries tend to comply with ISO 27001 standards, and aim to raise awareness among other sectors. While digital redundancy measures are not in place across all agencies, they have been implemented at Internet Exchange Points (IXP).\r\n\r\nSocietal awareness of cyber security, nonetheless, is generally low, as no national campaigns have taken place and 37.4% of the populace is connected to the internet.  In addition, few educational opportunities exist in the country for citizens interested in working in cyber security.","population":"573311","people_with_computer":"0","people_with_internet":"201963","mobile_phone_subscriptions":"980361","maturity_levels":{"1":"2","2":"1","3":"1","4":"1","5":"1","6":"1","7":"2","8":"2","9":"1","10":"1","11":"1","12":"1","13":"2","14":"2","15":"1","16":"1","17":"2","18":"1","19":"2","20":"2","21":"2","22":"1","23":"3","24":"1","25":"2","26":"1","27":"2","28":"1","29":"1","30":"1","31":"1","32":"1","33":"1","34":"1","35":"1","36":"1","37":"2","38":"1","39":"1","40":"1","41":"1","42":"1","43":"1","44":"1","45":"1","46":"1","47":"1","48":"1","49":"1"}},{"id":"30","code":"tt","name":"Trinidad and Tobago","excerpt":"","description":"With an ICT penetration rate of 65.1 percent in 2014\u2014up from 48.5 percent in 2010\u2014Trinidad and Tobago is among the most connected OAS member states. The Trinidad and Tobago government has actively sought to pursue ICT uptake, protect its digital assets, and foster economic development through the articulation of a national cyber security strategy, the identification of a competent authority, and the establishment of cyber incident response capabilities. \r\n\r\nIn response to a string of cyber attacks in 2011, Trinidad\u2019s Medium Term Policy Framework officially recognized both the role that ICTs play in advancing national development and economic growth and the need to develop effective cyber security initiatives to protect this core infrastructure.  In December 2012, the Ministry of National Security released a comprehensive national strategy detailing cyber risks to the country and delineating agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities. While there is no approved cyber defense policy, the J6 within the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force (TTDF) has overall responsibility for ICT and cyber-defence matters. Additionally, there exist IT Officers within the formations of the TTDF (Regiment, Coast Guard and Air Guard) who share cyber-defense responsibilities. This year, Trinidad and Tobago will officially launch the country\u2019s first National Computer Incident Response Team (TTCSIRT), which will work closely with the OAS, ITU, and other international organizations to develop incident response capacity. \r\n\r\nMany owners and operators of critical national infrastructure have crisis response or reporting mechanisms in place, particularly those within the private sector. The National Cyber Security Strategy calls for building competency among key stakeholders and developing incident management measures. Furthermore, adherence to international standards such as ISO 27001 is becoming widespread across government, telecommunications providers, security services, and the financial sector.  \r\n\r\nThe Minister of National Security has introduced a Cybercrime Bill to Parliament for enactment, which is meant to repeal the existing Computer Misuse Act and replace it with a more comprehensive legal framework for dealing with cybercrime. The country has also a data protection law, but it is only partially proclaimed. The Cybercrime Unit of the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS) handles cyber crime investigation and is equipped with a digital forensics lab. The successful prosecution of cyber crime, however, successful prosecution of cybercrime can be difficult, as courtrooms often lack digital-evidence capacities and there is no framework in place requiring the private sector to disclose cyber incidents.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of National Security has initiated its public awareness campaign. Additionally, the Ministry of Science and Technology and various public and private organizations, such as the University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTTI) and the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (TATT), have joined efforts to conduct workshops and other programs aimed at educating the public about cyber security. The private sector has also encouraged international training and accreditation programs for employees. While some universities offer courses on ethical hacking, there are currently no cyber security degree or certification programs in the country.","population":"1223916","people_with_computer":"0","people_with_internet":"856544","mobile_phone_subscriptions":"1799156","maturity_levels":{"1":"3","2":"2","3":"3","4":"2","5":"2","6":"3","7":"2","8":"2","9":"2","10":"1","11":"3","12":"2","13":"3","14":"4","15":"2","16":"2","17":"2","18":"1","19":"3","20":"3","21":"3","22":"2","23":"3","24":"3","25":"4","26":"2","27":"2","28":"3","29":"2","30":"1","31":"1","32":"2","33":"2","34":"2","35":"1","36":"2","37":"3","38":"3","39":"2","40":"2","41":"2","42":"2","43":"2","44":"1","45":"2","46":"3","47":"1","48":"2","49":"1"}},{"id":"31","code":"uy","name":"Uruguay","excerpt":"","description":"As of 2013, Uruguay had a high ICT penetration rate of 58.1 percent, which has been steadily rising from 46.4 percent in 2010.  The Uruguay government has sought to increase ICT uptake and protect its information assets via cyber security policies, incident response capabilities, training and workforce development, and legislation, helping to foster the Uruguay economy into the information age. \r\n\r\nThe Government of Uruguay passed Presidential Decree 452\/009 in 2009, which requires all government agencies to develop cyber security policies. Uruguay does not have a specific national strategy for cyber security, but its Information and Knowledge Society (AGESIC) includes cyber security in its 5-year Digital Agenda for 2011-2015, and will further emphasize cyber security in the next iteration of its 5-year plan.  Furthermore, Uruguay\u2019s National Defense Policy incorporates cyber defense measures. The country\u2019s national computer incident response mechanism, CERTuy, established in 2008, regularly coordinates with other regional CIRTs and international organizations. In addition to incident response, CERTuy provides statistics on cyber attacks and issues alerts on emerging risks. Uruguay also relies on incident analysis and response from the National Telecommunications Administration\u2019s CSIRT-ANTEL, which was founded in 2005 to address issues related to cellular phone data and services.  \r\n\r\nThe Government of Uruguay formally manages security for critical national infrastructure and shares information on CNI assets and vulnerabilities. It is also currently strengthening security and employee privacy standards. Uruguay is a regional leader in security software development and a marketplace for new technologies and cyber crime insurance. Government agencies execute risk management exercises to effectively coordinate response assets. In cases of emergency, the National Emergency System would issue redundancy communication. \r\n\r\nThe Computer Crime Unit of the National Police is the agency responsible for investigating cyber crime. It maintains a digital forensic laboratory and receives capacity building support from the OAS and other organizations. In recent years, the unit has detected an increase in cyber crime. The Government of Uruguay has drafted a legal framework for cyber security and has adopted Law No 18.331 on Data Protection. However, it has not adopted criminal law specific to cyber crime and has no disclosure mechanisms in place for the private sector. Uruguay is party to MERCOSUR Digital, which aims to normalize e-commerce and cyber security across member states. Furthermore, major private-sector areas and the banking industry are well-educated on both cyber threats and strategies to protect against them.\r\n\r\nAcademia and the public and private sectors offer opportunities for training and education in cyber security, and the government has been working to bolster cyber security educational initiatives. It has also launched national awareness-raising campaigns, namely \u201cConnect yourself safely\u201d, led by CERTuy, and \u201cYour data has worth. Protect it\u201d, led by AGESIC.

It has recently increased its staff size, but requires new techniques and tools to keep pace with emerging cyber threats. \r\n\r\nVenezuela has neither a national cyber security policy nor a cyber-defense strategy, but it has adopted a number of laws that together constitute a comprehensive legal framework for cybercrime. Special Law against Computer Crime (Law 37.313) was enacted in 2001, and the National Assembly has recently passed the Interoperability Act (2012) and Info-Government Act (2013) which establish standards and norms for electronic exchange, as well as some procedural law. Although the Constitution provides for freedom of expression, there are no laws in place dealing specifically with privacy or freedom of expression online. \r\n\r\nThree agencies form the country\u2019s primary response to cybercrime: the Cybercrime Division of the Center for Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigations (CICPC), the National Center for Digital Forensics (CENIF) and the Superintendency of Electronic Certification Services (SUSCERTE). Government routinely provides for training for CICPC personnel to ensure that they are up to date on cybercrime trends. \r\n\r\nThrough its plan Secure Homeland (Patria Segura), SUSCERTE formally manages security for CNI technology, issues digital certificates and keeps statistics on incidents. CNI operators have begun to adopt security measures to comply with international standards, and have basic capacity to protect infrastructure from cyberattacks. \r\n\r\nIn addition to issuing digital certificates for government and CNI technology and keeping statistics, SUSCERTE has lead the \u201cInformation Security Begins with You\u201d campaign, which aims to educate the public on cyber security through talks, fora and workshops. A number of cyber security and cybercrime degree programs are also available in the country. Nevertheless, a lack of societal awareness of cyber security and limited privacy protection for citizens continue to present challenges to Venezuela\u2019s cyber security regime.","population":"28868486","people_with_computer":"0","people_with_internet":"14548421","mobile_phone_subscriptions":"28579800","maturity_levels":{"1":"1","2":"1","3":"1","4":"1","5":"1","6":"1","7":"1","8":"2","9":"1","10":"2","11":"2","12":"2","13":"2","14":"1","15":"1","16":"2","17":"1","18":"1","19":"2","20":"2","21":"3","22":"2","23":"3","24":"1","25":"2","26":"2","27":"2","28":"1","29":"1","30":"1","31":"1","32":"2","33":"3","34":"2","35":"3","36":"3","37":"3","38":"1","39":"1","40":"1","41":"2","42":"1","43":"2","44":"1","45":"1","46":"1","47":"1","48":"1","49":"1"}}],"dimensions":[{"id":"1","name":"Dimension 1","title":"Policy","factors":[{"id":"1","code":"D1-1","title":"Documented or Official National Cyber Security Strategy","description":"","indicators":[{"id":"1","title":"Strategy Development","maturity_level1_text":"No evidence of a national cyber security strategy exists;
